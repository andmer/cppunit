This is a fork of the original CPPUnit library, cloned from the original svn
repository (which was apparently forked from a CVS repository).

I will accept patches to this version of CPPUnit and, if sufficient new 
features or bugfixes warrant it, release a new version as CPPUnit-forked.

I do not intend to go on any large coding binges: CPPUnit has been stable 
and usable for many years, and I have no intention of changing that - I just
intend to allow improving on it.
